# Machine Learning A to Z
## Overview
This repository documents my machine learning journey
## [01 Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/jerrvonewing/machine-learning-a-to-z/blob/main/01-Data-Preprocessing/data_preprocessing.ipynb)
This section contains a Jupyter Notebook that takes in a CSV file containing mock data to determine if a customer would make a purchase using our machine learning model

This section demonstrates:

- Reading data from a CSV file using **pandas**
- Importing missing values using **SimpleImputer** from the **sklearn** module
- Updating matrices using the **SimpleImputer** transform method
- Creating a **OneHotEncoder** instance for a column of strings
